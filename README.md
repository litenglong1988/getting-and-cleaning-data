## run_analysis.R

- step1: download the script file "run_analysis.R" in your working dictionary
- step2: opening you Rstudio and run the R code: source("run_analysis.R")
- step3: opening you working dictionary, you will find a file called "tidyData.txt", which was the script generated, and it is which I submitted for part 1

## codebook.MD

- This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

## tidyData.txt
